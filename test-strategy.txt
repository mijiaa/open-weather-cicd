The first testing strategy we wanted to implement was branch coverage, where we go through every possible branch in the
program and test every possible test input to cover all branches. We then implemented a few test cases and realised that
we couldn't test for every single possible input. So we decided to use modified coverage/ decision coverage for our
function, which is called check_command_args.

The way we are going to implement MC/DC on the first function:
1) to consider the command's check. This will apply to all the checks from line 16 to 18
2)
